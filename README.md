# tavisualcomputing

This repository contains the exercises proposed to the students of the course of Visual Computing at ETH Zurich.<br>

This actually mirrors the project at https://notebooks.azure.com/ta-visual-computing/projects/visual-computing to provide version control to azure notebooks.

For easy version control, just use the notebook version_control.ipynb.
